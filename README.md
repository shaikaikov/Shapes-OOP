# Shapes-OOP
this project done in java.
this project deal with OOP of shapes.the task divided into few parts:
1.in the first part I built the classes-Triangle2D,Point2D, Rect2D, Circle2D, Segment2D. from that I can create the shapes objects.
2.in the second part I built the GUIShape class.from that I create object that contain the shape object.in additon contain fields of
flag-if I will express the shape in grapic way.if I will express the shape -in what color I will express.
3.in the third part I implemented the Shape_Collection class-this class is data structure for holding the GUIShape objects-
and remove from the data structure or to add the data structure (the objects-GUIShape).in addition the class can to write the objects to (from the data structure) file or to restore the objects from a file into the data structure.in the data structure I can to sort the objects with the Comparator class.
4.in this part I built the Ex4 class.the class contain the Shape_Collection object(the data structure).with the Ex4 class I create the Ex4 object(in the Main class) and with that I show the shapes objects inside a frame correspondingly to their sort of the shapes in the Shape_Collection object.
